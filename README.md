Prodigy Task 3

Here's a concise approach to build a decision tree classifier for predicting customer purchases:

Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the Bank Marketing dataset, handling categorical variables and splitting into train/test sets.

Model Training: Initialize and train a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Interpretation: Visualize the decision tree to understand feature importance and decision paths.

Optimization: Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters like max depth for better predictive performance.
